# Height-Converter Infomration 
This script/program pretty much is just a basic metric calculator for the metric inches, it's very simple by just imputing the number of inches and then clicking the button that you want the inches to be translated to. This has a very clean UI and is very easy to edit and change to any metric you would like.
